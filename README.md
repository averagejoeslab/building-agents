# Building agents

By **[Chase Dovey](https://cdovey.dev/)** · [Average Joes Lab](https://github.com/averagejoeslab)

An agent has two parts: **a model** and **a harness**.

**Agent = Harness(Model)**

## The model

A model predicts. Tokens go in, it returns the most probable next token, and that token is added to the input. It repeats until it predicts `<eos>`, the end-of-sequence token.

```
            ┌──────────── append ◄────────────┐
            ▼                                 │
TokensIn ─► Model ─► most probable next token ─┤
                                               │
                                     is it <eos>? ── yes ─► TokensOut
```

**TokensOut = Model(TokensIn)**

That's all it does.

## The harness

The harness is everything else. It's been called a framework, a scaffold, a runtime and an orchestration layer, and the industry has mostly settled on *harness*.

Think of the model as an engine. On its own, it just turns. The harness is the rest of the vehicle: it's what makes the engine go somewhere.

Every harness does five things. These are its primitives:

| Primitive | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Input** | captures what comes in |
| **Context** | assembles the minimum the model needs to act well on this input |
| **Model interface** | requests a response from the model |
| **Output** | handles the response: shows it, or runs it as a tool |
| **Control flow** | decides what happens next: go again, hand back, or stop |

```
┌──────────────────────── control flow ─────────────────────────┐
│                                                                │
│  input ─► context ─► model interface ─► output ─┬─► person     │
│    ▲                    (the model)              │             │
│    └────────────────── a tool's result ──────────┘             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Building quark

A quark is one of the smallest particles there is. **quark** is the smallest agent: the five primitives and nothing more. We'll build it one primitive at a time.

Every step gets the same job. A small project has a function, `total()` in `prices.py`, that adds up a basket and takes off a percentage discount, and a test that fails. The request is always: *"The tests are failing. Find out why and fix it."*

In the runs, `>` is what I typed, `<` is what quark said, and `$` is a command it ran.

### 1. Model interface

We have a model, and no way to reach it. So we request a response:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

model = Anthropic()


def request_response(context):
    return model.messages.create(model="claude-sonnet-5-5", max_tokens=16384, **context)


response = request_response({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The tests are failing. Find out why and fix it."}]})
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

What comes back (shortened):

```
{
  "id": "msg_011CfnEtbEGGFJTpJ4xHGpD9",
  "content": [
    {
      "text": "I don't have access to your code, test files, or test output. Nothing came through in your message besides the request. ...",
      "type": "text"
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-sonnet-5-5",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  ...
}
```

Tokens in, tokens out. But the request is written into the code: nobody can ask it anything.

### 2. Input

So we capture what comes in:

```python
def capture_input():
    return input("\n> ")
```

and send that instead:

```python
response = request_response({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": capture_input()}]})
```

Now you can type the request. The answer (shortened) is the same:

```
> The tests are failing. Find out why and fix it.
{
  ...
      "text": "I don't have the code or the test output yet, so I can't tell why the tests are failing. Could you share: ...",
  ...
}
```

It can only talk. It can't look at a file, and its answer is still raw.

### 3. Output

So we give it a tool, bash, and handle the response: show its words, run its commands.

```python
bash = {"name": "bash", "description": "Run a shell command",
        "input_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["command"]}}
```

```python
def handle_output(response):
    tool_results = []
    for block in response.content:
        if block.type == "text":
            print("< " + block.text.replace("\n", "\n  "))
        if block.type == "tool_use":
            print(f"$ {block.input['command']}")
            ran = subprocess.run(block.input["command"], shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
            tool_results.append({"type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": block.id, "content": ran.stdout + ran.stderr or "(no output)"})
    return tool_results
```

```python
response = request_response({"tools": [bash], "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": capture_input()}]})
handle_output(response)
```

```
> The tests are failing. Find out why and fix it.
< I'll start by exploring the project and running the tests.
$ pwd; ls -la; git status 2>/dev/null | head
```

It acted, and then it stopped. The result of that command went nowhere, so the model never saw it.

### 4. Control flow

So we decide what happens next. If a tool ran, its result goes back and the model goes again. If not, it's your turn.

```python
def control_flow():
    conversation = []
    while True:
        conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": capture_input()})
        while True:
            response = request_response({"tools": [bash], "messages": conversation})
            conversation.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})
            tool_results = handle_output(response)
            if not tool_results:
                break                                    # done: hand back to the person
            conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": tool_results})   # a tool ran: go again
```

```
> The tests are failing. Find out why and fix it.
< Let me start by looking at the project and running the tests.
$ pwd; ls -la; git status 2>/dev/null | head
$ cat prices.py test_prices.py; python -m pytest -q 2>&1 | tail -30
$ python -m unittest -v 2>&1 | tail -20
< The docstring says the discount is a percentage, but the code subtracts it as a flat amount. So 25 − 10 = 15 instead of 25 × 0.9 = 22.5. I'll fix the code to match the documented behavior.
$ sed -i 's|return round(subtotal - discount, 2)|return round(subtotal * (1 - discount / 100), 2)|' prices.py && cat prices.py && python -m unittest 2>&1 | tail -5
< The tests pass now. The bug was in `prices.py`, not in the tests.
  ...

> Commit the fix.
$ git add prices.py && git commit -q -m "Fix total() to apply discount as a percentage ..." && git log --oneline -3 && git status --short
< I committed the fix as `d6beb65`, "Fix total() to apply discount as a percentage". Only `prices.py` is in the commit.
  ...
```

(shortened)

That's an agent: the inner loop goes until the job's done, and the outer loop hands back to you. "Commit the fix" needed no explaining, because the whole conversation goes back every time.

But it has to go looking for what it needs. Start it fresh and ask the simplest question:

```
> Who are you, and where are you working?
< I'll check the environment first so I can answer accurately.
$ echo "user: $(whoami)"; echo "host: $(hostname)"; echo "cwd: $(pwd)"; uname -a; ls -la | head -20
< I'm an AI assistant. I can run shell commands, and I use that to read files, run code and make changes in the environment I'm given.
  ...
```

(shortened)

### 5. Context

So we assemble the minimum it needs to act well on any input. For quark, that's who it is, where it's working and what day it is:

```python
def assemble_context(conversation):
    instructions = f"You are quark, an agent. You act through bash, in {os.getcwd()}. Today is {datetime.date.today()}."
    return {"system": instructions, "tools": [bash], "messages": conversation}
```

```python
            response = request_response(assemble_context(conversation))
```

```
> Who are you, and where are you working?
< I'm quark, an agent that works by running shell commands through bash. My working directory is /tmp/shop. Today's date is 2026-10-07.
  ...
```

(shortened)

No commands needed. Too little context and it wastes steps finding things out. Too much, and every request costs more and buries what matters.

That's all five primitives, and that's [`quark.py`](./quark.py).

## Run it

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/).

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then put your key in .env
uv run --env-file .env quark.py
```

Ctrl-C quits.

> [!WARNING]
> quark runs the model's shell commands without asking. Run it somewhere you can afford to lose.

## From quark to production

quark works, but it isn't ready to run unattended. Getting it there means asking one question of every primitive, in turn:

| Concern | The question |
|---|---|
| Safety | what could do harm here? |
| Resilience | what could fail here? |
| Observability | what should we record here? |
| Performance | what's slow or costly here? |
| Evaluation | how do we know it still works? |

Claude Code, Cursor and every other agent are these same five primitives, hardened in these ways.
